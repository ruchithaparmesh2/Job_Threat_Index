 The "Job Threat Index" project assesses AI's impact on job automation with a Kaggle 
dataset and a KNN regressor model. It predicts job replacement likelihood, guiding policymakers 
and businesses in workforce planning and reskilling. By doing this, the project aims to lessen the 
negative impact on the economy and help businesses and workers adapt to changes caused by AI 
technology.
